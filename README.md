The basic purpose of designing this project is to get rid from manual entry and to automate
the activities of the hostel. This project is designed to keep the record of the students living
in hostels , allocation of rooms, their monthly or semester wise payments dues and many
more things. It helps to avoid the complexity and to reduce time in data processing.
It eases the processes of the students to book the room online. And the entire profile of the
students will be visible to the administrator. This software is very flexible and it can be
upgraded according to the hostel needs. It is capable of managing hostel rooms, student
records and room allocation process etc. It is a user-friendly and customised software for
providing support for hostel admin.
